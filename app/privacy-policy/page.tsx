            <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <p className="mb-2"><i>Scope of Our Policy</i></p>
            <p className="mb-2">We are very sensitive to the privacy concerns of our customers. We believe that privacy of personal information is a serious matter and we strive to manage and protect any information we collect from you or you may share with us in a careful, sensible and lawful manner. When we say “personal information” we mean nonpublic information about you that may include first and last name, address, and numbers such as credit card numbers provided by you. This policy describes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>How and why we collect your personal information.</li>
            <li>How your information is used and shared.</li>
            <li>How we protect your information.</li>
            <li>How you can control the use of your information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2">By visiting any of our websites, you accept our practices as set forth in this notice. We encourage you to carefully read our policy to understand how we manage this information. Laws and practices governing the handling of this information are constantly changing; as a result we may and do update this policy from time to time. We will not necessarily directly notify you of all changes so you are urged to periodically read and review our policy to take note of any changes.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><i>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It. </i></p>
            <p className="mb-2">We collect personally identifiable information about you through this Website when you directly provide this information to us in connection with one of the services we provide, such as when you make a reservation with our hotel or restaurant, make a purchase, or when you voluntarily provide us information by filling out forms or subscribing to our email newsletters. We may also collect some information about you, such as usage details and IP address, automatically as you navigate the Website through cookies and similar technology.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><i>Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies. </i></p>
            <p className="mb-2">As you navigate through and interact with our Website, we may use various automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about Website traffic data; the resources you access and use on the Website; and your IP address, operating system, and browser type. These technologies help us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and help you use our website by storing information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests, speed up your searches, and recognize you when you return to our Website.</p>
            <p className="mb-2">Two automatic data technologies we may use for this automatic data collection include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Cookies.</b> A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.</li>
            <li><b>Web Beacons.</b> Pages of the Website and our e-mails may sometimes contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, opened an email, or for other related website statistics, such as determining the popularity of certain website content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2">Cookies are generally used in two ways by our Website:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To manage state. “State” refers to the settings and choices made by you as you use our Website. As information is transferred to and from your computer and our web server, state is managed so that our Website works seamlessly, and so that you do not have to enter the same information repeatedly. During state management, only a random identifier is placed in a cookie for our web server to use. Personal information or other state information is NOT stored in the cookie. State management cookies are automatically deleted when you close your web browser.</li>
            <li>To manage automation of the user experience. If applicable, our web server may “remember” you between visits to make it easier for you to use our Website on future visits. If we provide this feature, your user account identifier will be saved to a cookie on your computer hard drive, and will be used each time you come back to our Website. No personal information is saved in the cookie itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2"><i>Use and Sharing of Information</i></p>
            <p className="mb-2">We may disclose aggregated information that does not identify any individual without restriction. We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Notice:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To our subsidiaries and affiliates;</li>
            <li>To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business;</li>
            <li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets;</li>
            <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it;</li>
            <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information; and</li>
            <li>With your consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2">We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
            <li>To enforce or apply our Terms of Use, Terms and Conditions of Online Sales, and for billing and collection purposes.</li>
            <li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of HOA Group, our customers, or others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2"><b>Security.</b> We and our technology providers employ commercially-reasonable security safeguards to protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. If you are required to transmit sensitive information to us through our Website (such as payment information), we will secure that information through data encryption. We will protect personally identifiable information stored on the Website’s servers from unauthorized access by using commercially available computer security products (such as firewalls), as well as our own security procedures and practices. Although we take these steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><b>Changes to our Notice.</b> If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Websites. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email and by updating this policy. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><b>Children’s Privacy.</b> The content of our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and HOA Group does not knowingly collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 at our Site without parental consent. Please contact us via the contact address below if you believe we may have collected information from your child without permission from you and we will work to delete it.</p>
